<h1  align="center">CPU Design Space Exploration</h1>

## Overview
This project, part of CMPEN 431, involves exploring the design space of CPU configurations to optimize performance and Energy-Delay Product (EDP). The project leverages a provided framework to test and modify various processor parameters, aiming to find the most efficient configuration in terms of performance and energy consumption.

## Features
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows testing of different combinations of processor parameters.
- **Performance and EDP Optimization**: Focuses on achieving the best configuration for performance and EDP.
- **Heuristic-Based Exploration**: Utilizes a heuristic approach for traversal of dimensions, optimizing configurations under set iterations.

## Usage
1. **Setting Up**: Ensure the Simplescalar framework is installed and configured.
2. **Running Simulations**: Use the script to run simulations with different configurations.
3. **Analyzing Results**: Evaluate the performance and EDP for each configuration to find the optimal one.

## Insights Gained
- Understanding of how different design parameters affect a processorâ€™s performance and energy consumption.
- The effectiveness of using a simulator, like Simplescalar, for design space exploration, bypassing exhaustive methods.

## Additional Resources
- Simplescalar Framework
- Microsoft Excel for plotting
